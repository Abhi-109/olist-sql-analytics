## Insight 1: Revenue is concentrated among a small group of high-value customers

What we found:
The top 10 customers generate individual lifetime revenues ranging from approximately 4.5K to 13.6K. This is significantly higher than the typical customer, indicating a strong revenue concentration among a very small subset of users.

Why it matters:
High customer revenue concentration increases business risk. Losing even a few high-value customers can cause a noticeable revenue drop. It also suggests that the majority of customers contribute relatively small amounts.

Action / Recommendation:
Implement targeted retention strategies such as loyalty programs, personalized discounts, and priority support for high-value customers while simultaneously working to increase average order value for mid-tier customers.

## Insight 2: The customer base is dominated by one-time buyers

What we found:
Most customers place only one delivered order, with repeat buyers forming a much smaller portion of the customer base.

Why it matters:
A business driven primarily by one-time buyers faces higher acquisition costs and lower lifetime value. This indicates weak customer retention and limited long-term engagement.

Action / Recommendation:
Introduce post-purchase engagement tactics such as follow-up offers, reorder reminders, and subscription-style incentives to convert one-time buyers into repeat customers.

## Insight 3: A large portion of customers are inactive and at churn risk

What we found:
Out of all customers with delivered orders, approximately 57,154 are inactive, while only 39,324 are active based on the 6-month activity rule.

Why it matters:
Inactive customers represent lost revenue potential and indicate churn. Ignoring this group leads to declining growth and inefficient customer acquisition spending.

Action / Recommendation:
Launch re-engagement campaigns for inactive customers using targeted promotions, email reminders, and limited-time offers to reactivate dormant users.

## Insight 4: Revenue shows strong growth over time with clear expansion phases

What we found:
Monthly revenue increased substantially from early 2017 through late 2017, peaking above 1.15M in November 2017, before showing volatility in 2018.

Why it matters:
Sustained growth periods indicate successful scaling, while later volatility highlights sensitivity to market conditions, seasonality, or operational constraints.

Action / Recommendation:
Analyze drivers behind peak growth periods and replicate successful strategies, while preparing contingency plans to stabilize revenue during slower months.

## Insight 5: Month-over-month revenue growth is highly volatile

What we found:
Month-over-month growth fluctuates sharply, ranging from extreme spikes (over 60,000% during early low-base periods) to significant declines exceeding -25% in later months.

Why it matters:
High volatility complicates forecasting, inventory planning, and cash-flow management. It also increases operational risk during downturns.

Action / Recommendation:
Adopt rolling forecasts and monitor leading indicators such as order volume and customer activity to anticipate revenue changes earlier.

## Insight 6: Product revenue is highly concentrated within a few top products each month

What we found:
Each month, a small number of products consistently rank in the top 5 by revenue, while the majority of products contribute marginal revenue.

Why it matters:
Heavy reliance on a limited product set exposes the business to supply chain, pricing, or demand shocks affecting those products.

Action / Recommendation:
Diversify revenue by promoting mid-tier products, expanding successful product categories, and reducing dependency on a small number of top-performing SKUs.

## Insight 7: Seller revenue is concentrated among a limited group of sellers

What we found:
The top 10 sellers each contribute approximately 1.0%–1.6% of total delivered revenue, collectively representing a meaningful share of marketplace performance.

Why it matters:
Seller concentration creates platform dependency. Operational issues or churn among top sellers could significantly impact total revenue and customer satisfaction.

Action / Recommendation:
Strengthen seller retention programs for top performers while investing in onboarding and scaling mid-tier sellers to reduce concentration risk.

## Insight 8: Installment payments dominate total revenue

What we found:
Installment-based payments account for approximately 63% of total delivered revenue, while non-installment payments contribute about 37%.

Why it matters:
Installment payments play a critical role in revenue generation but may introduce financial risk related to delayed payments, defaults, or higher processing costs.

Action / Recommendation:
Optimize installment offerings by partnering with reliable payment providers, monitoring default risk, and offering incentives for shorter installment plans to improve cash flow.

## Insight 9: Payment behavior suggests customers prefer flexible payment options

What we found:
The strong dominance of installment payments indicates a clear customer preference for flexible payment structures when making purchases.

Why it matters:
Flexible payments can increase conversion rates but may reduce immediate liquidity and increase operational complexity.

Action / Recommendation:
Balance flexibility and risk by segmenting installment options based on customer creditworthiness and purchase history.

## Insight 10: Overall marketplace revenue depends on retention, diversification, and financial structure

What we found:
Across customers, products, sellers, and payment behavior, revenue is consistently concentrated in small groups, while inactivity and volatility remain high.

Why it matters:
Without improvements in retention, diversification, and revenue stability, long-term growth may stall despite short-term spikes.

Action / Recommendation:
Adopt a balanced growth strategy focusing on customer retention, seller and product diversification, and optimized payment models to ensure sustainable marketplace expansion.
